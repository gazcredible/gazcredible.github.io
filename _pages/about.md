Hello, I’m Gareth Lewis and I’m an experienced creative technologist currently working in the academic water sector as a research fellow at the Centre for Water Systems in the University of Exeter, [link](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/centres/cws/).

My work at Exter is predominantly concerned with developing and operating application servers to organise standalone piecemeal research into web-based research-as-a-service for a number of international EU Horizon Europe and UKRI funded projects.

Prior to joining Exeter, I worked as a video game developer and lecturer, working for a number of developers including Lionhead, Sony and Virgin, and teaching (mainly part-time) with Falmouth, Plymouth, Goldsmiths, Westminster and St. Martins, before working with several start-ups (Game Sessions, Remode, Mutators) before co-founding the SEIS-funded Strike Game Labs.
