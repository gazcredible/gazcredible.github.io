**2020-present Research Fellow, Centre for Water Systems, University of Exeter.**  
Full-stack web developer, developing and converting standalone piecemeal research into web-based research-as-a-service, using Python-based flask and Django frameworks, docker-based vanilla linux, AWS, and Heroku stacks, and Javascript clients typically using Bootstrap and Mapbox / Maplibre for GIS visualisation. Worked on multiple research projects funded through EU Horizon Europe and UKRI, typically €4-20M budgets, with 10-40 EU partners, highlights:

* **ARSINOE** [Homepage](https://arsinoe-project.eu/about/), is a €14.5M research project aiming to develop quantitative models of climate resilience based on climate change.  
    
* My role has been to develop an environmental digital twin service for Athens, Torbay, and the Alikacom river region pilots to demonstrate resilience across multiple domains (urban heat, flooding, and water quality), using a Django / Python / Javascript / Bootstrap / Mapbox / docker stack.  
    
* **WATERVERSE** [Homepage](https://waterverse.eu/), is a €4.5M research project aiming to develop a Water Data Management Ecosystem (WDME) for making data management practices and resources in the water sector accessible, affordable, secure, fair, and easy to use.  
    
* My role has been to develop a multi-pilot synthetic data generation tool to produce time series sensor data on-demand, and to develop a flood prediction web-service for using CAFlood flood modelling app using a Django / Python / Javascript / Bootstrap / Mapbox / docker stack.  
    
* **AQUA3S** [Homepage](https://aqua3s.eu/), was a €6M research project that aimed to combine novel technologies in water safety and security, aiming to standardise existing sensor technologies complemented by state-of-the-art detection mechanisms.  
    
* My role was to develop a back-end time-series database compliant with the FIWARE/ngsi-ld specification and develop a visualisation dashboard for monitoring and responding to water supply issues for 5 European pilots using a Flask / Python / JavaScript / Bootstrap / Mapbox / MapLibre / Docker / AWS stack.  
    
* **FIWARE4WATER** [Homepage](https://www.fiware4water.eu/), was a €4M research project that aimed to link the water sector to FIWARE by demonstrating its capabilities and the potential of its interoperable and standardised interfaces for both water sector end-users and solution providers.  
    
* My role has been to develop a flutter-based mobile app (iOS\&Android) and associated backend for smart metering trials (200 client meters in Devon), and to develop a simulated consumption model of the trial meters using a Django / Python / Flutter / Heroku stack.  
    
* **LOTUS** [Homepage](https://www.lotus-india.eu/), was a €4.4M research project that aimed to develop LOw-cost innovative Technology for water quality monitoring and water resources management for Urban and rural water Systems in India.  
    
* My role was to design a service architecture for full-water lifecycle data management across 5 pilots, and to develop a desktop leak and water quality simulation web app for 3rd party algorithm development based on the Guwahati water distribution network using a Django / Python / Javascript / Bootstrap / Mapbox / pywebview electron-style desktop stack.
